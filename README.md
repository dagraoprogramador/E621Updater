You put in your username, then the range of hours you want to search, wait for a while, and the artists you've favored a post from will start appearing based on the date of their last post. The names are hyperlinks, so you just click on them. I'm not a very good programmer, but i was able to get through cors alright, so it works on all browsers, i think.
